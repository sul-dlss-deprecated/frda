        The online Bassi-Veratti Collection is a multi-year collaboration of
        the Stanford University Libraries, the Biblioteca Comunale
        dell’Archiginnasio, Bologna, Italy, and the Istituto per i Beni
        Artistici, Culturali e Naturali della Regione Emilia-Romagna, to produce
        a digital version of the archive of the influential woman scientist,
        Laura Bassi. Part of the rich collections of the Archiginnasio, the
        collection contains not only materials about Laura Bassi, but also those
        of her husband, scientist Giuseppe Veratti, their children, and his
        family.

        The Stanford Digital Repository ensures each digital object is
        preserved, made available via a permanent persistent URL
        (web address), enforces content rights and restrictions and provides
        a common storage mechanism for other applications to build upon.

        The Bassi-Veratti Collection is being built on top of the Stanford
        Digital Repository to provide a web based platform for discovery and
        study of the archive. The Collection is developed in
        <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> using open
        source technologies, including
        <a href="http://projectblacklight.org/">Blacklight</a>,

        Laura Bassi (1711-1778) was one of the most important and visible
        scientific women in eighteenth-century Europe. In 1732 she was the
        second woman to receive a university degree in Europe and the first
        to be offered an official university teaching position, both at the
        University of Bologna. She was the first female member of the
        Bologna Academy of Sciences, one of Italy’s leading academies, and
        played a significant role in the spread of Newtonian experimental
        physics through her teaching, research, and correspondence. While
        little documentary evidence of her own scientific work survives, she
        nonetheless had an active program of research and experimentation
        for many decades and was widely reputed to be an outstanding teacher
        of experimental physics. Bassi carried on extensive correspondence
        with other natural philosophers of her time, including Alessandro
        Volta, Lazzaro Spallanzani, Giovanni Battista Beccaria,
        Jean-François Nollet, Voltaire, and Francesco Algarotti.

        Encouraged in her studies by her family and by the intellectual
        community of Bologna, at the age of twenty she was invited to give a
        public debate of 49 philosophical and physical theses. Not long
        after this success, she received a special doctorate from the
        University of Bologna, followed soon after by an ex officio
        appointment to a chair in philosophy at the university. In Bologna
        she presented dissertations on subjects such as gravity,
        refrangibility, mechanics, and hydraulics. With her husband,
        Giuseppe Veratti, she made Bologna a center for experimental
        research in electricity. Laura Bassi was a high-profile public
        figure who disputed frequently in public, appeared regularly at
        Bologna’s annual carnival anatomy, attracted high-profile visitors
        to Bologna from across Europe, wrote poetry for important public
        functions, and enjoyed the patronage of many contemporaries. Despite
        her very true public presence, however, most of Bassi’s teaching and
        research took place in her home, where from 1749 until her death,
        she and her husband established a laboratory, taught classes in
        experimental physics and natural philosophy, and presided over a
        lively scientific “salon.” In 1776 she was named professor of
        experimental physics at the Bologna Academy of Sciences, with her
        husband as her assistant. Giuseppe Veratti, her husband and
        intellectual partner, took over the professorship when his wife died
        only two years later;while Laura Bassi was celebrated during her
        lifetime and is the focus of current research, we lack any studies
        of him. Their youngest son Paolo Veratti continued to teach
        experimental physics from the family physics cabinet but never
        entirely replicated the success of either parent.

        The Bassi-Veratti Collection at the Archiginnasio is key to any
        research on Laura Bassi, her husband Giuseppe Veratti, and their
        family. Given her busy life as scientist, educator, poet, wife, and
        mother, Laura Bassi’s published output does not reflect the full
        scope of her accomplishments. Only the public disputations that
        launched her career and four treatises in the Commentarii of the
        Academy of Sciences were published. We know that during her lifetime
        she was a celebrated figure in the intellectual life of Bologna and
        that she played an important role in spreading Newtonian ideas of
        physics and natural philosophy in Italy in the 18th century, but
        less about her daily activities and those of her family. The
        Bassi-Veratti Collection consists of 12 boxes. Two boxes contain
        legal documents and deeds of both families; two are devoted to
        materials on Laura Bassi, and the rest hold materials about her
        husband Giuseppe Veratti, their son Paolo who became a physician and
        an experimental physicist and like both parents, professor at the
        University of Bologna, as well as additional family papers on the
        Bassi and especially the Veratti families. These papers were donated
        to the Archiginnasio in 1922-1924. In addition to scholarly writings
        and legal papers, the archive holds correspondence and poetry
        written in honor of accomplishments and noteworthy events in Bassi’s
        life as well as materials commemorating her death, publications by
        and about the family members, and medals.

        The online Bassi-Veratti Collection was first conceived in 2010
        through discussion between the Stanford University Libraries, the
        Archiginnasio, the Soprintendenza of the Region of Emilia-Romagna,
        and Stanford Professor of History, Paula Findlen. Its development
        has truly been a international collaboration, with the Archiginnasio
        providing the archive itself, its inventory and expertise about the
        collection’s contents, history, and arrangement, and Stanford
        librarians and digital technology specialists transforming the
        inventory into a digital finding aid, managing the digitization work
        from afar, and conceptualizing and creating the bilingual interface.

        The online Bassi-Veratti Collection brings historical primary source
        materials to scholars and students around the world. It consists of
        an online interface offering access to the digitized versions of all
        of the materials of the Bassi-Veratti Collection at the
        Archiginnasio in Bologna. Access is via a detailed archival
        inventory, or finding aid. This inventory has been tagged so that
        researchers can search using keywords and index terms. Because the
        inventory’s contents are linked to the corresponding digital images,
        scholars can easily navigate from the descriptions of the materials
        to the digital facsimiles.
