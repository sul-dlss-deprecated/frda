        <p>The <em>Archives parlementaires</em> is a chronologically-ordered edited collection of sources on
        the French Revolution. It was conceived in the mid 19th century as a project to produce a definitive
        record of parliamentary deliberations and also includes letters, reports, speeches, and other
        first-hand accounts from a great variety of published and archival sources. Because of copyright
        limitations, <em>FRDA</em> contains the <em>AP</em> volumes covering the years 1787-1794. The text of
        these volumes has been marked up using TEI so that speakers, places, dates, and terms in the published
        index can be easily found.</p>
         <p>While the <em>AP</em> started as a curatorial endeavor spearheaded by government archivists, it
        later became a scholarly project under the direction of leading historians. This massive collection of
        historical sources was initiated in 1862 at the request of the French legislature, and by 1914 had
        reached 82 volumes, each around 800 double-columned pages, covering the years 1789-1794. After a long
        period of dormancy, the project was taken up again in 1962 by the <em>Institut d’histoire de la
        Revolution française</em> at the Université de Paris I; its progress is ongoing. The current digital
        archive contains only the first 82 volumes from the first series of the <em>Archives
        parlementaires</em>, published before the Great War. These volumes roughly cover the first five years
        of the French Revolution, from the <em>Cahiers des états généraux</em> of 1789 until 15 nivôse an II (4
        January 1794). They record the events ranging from the convening of the Estates General through the
        first half of the Terror.</p>
         <p>The <em>Archives parlementaires</em> provide an unparalleled view into the workings of the
        Revolution through the thoughts and actions of its participants. The work is a day-to-day record of
        debates and discussions held by the three parliamentary bodies that legislated for France between 1789
        and 1794. The first seven volumes of the <em>AP</em> present the <em>Cahiers de doléances</em> sent to
        the Estates General in 1789. Subsequent volumes draw primarily on official minutes of parliamentary
        debates, but also include journalistic accounts of the proceedings, speeches prepared for delivery but
        never presented, as well as letters, reports, and other documents received or reviewed by the assembly.
        Fragmented power, multiple authorities, and accounts from various and conflicting perspectives further
        complicate the record. Given the Revolution’s rapid pace, the <em>AP</em>’s detailed and layered
        chronological organization of Revolutionary sources provides an invaluable narrative to scholars. Over
        the decades, the <em>AP</em> has come to be accepted by scholars as the functional equivalent of
        primary documentation, and it is virtually all scholars’ first recourse for research into the
        deliberative record of the Revolution through 1794. </p>

        <p>The <em>Images</em> are composed of high-resolution digital images of approximately 12,000
        individual visual items, primarily prints, but also illustrations, medals, coins, and other objects,
        which display aspects of the Revolution. These materials were selected from across the BnF’s
        departments, and include thousands of images for the important collections entitled Hennin and De
        Vinck. Detailed metadata exists for the images, so that researchers can search by artist, subject,
        genre, and place. </p>
         <p>The FRDA provides access to the most complete searchable digital archive of French Revolution
        images available. <em>Images de la Révolution française</em> is a benchmark image-base undertaken by
        the Bibliothèque nationale de France on the occasion of the Revolution’s bicentennial in 1989. It aimed
        to “allow the reader to explore the relationships, articulations and confrontations between the ideas
        of the Revolution and their metaphorical embodiment, the constant cross-fertilization of ideology and
        make-believe…” For this project the BnF created over 38,000 separate views of over 14, 000 individual
        images, showing closeups and dividing documents with discrete iconographic materials into appropriate
        sections. The <em>Images</em>, which were originally offered in analog format on laserdisc, had become
        extremely difficult to access due to rapid technological change. Within the framework of its
        digitization programs, the BnF rescanned at high resolution almost half of the images on the laserdisc
        from the original materials. New JPEG files were created from the original videodisc for the remaining
        images in the corpus. Now all of these images are available online as part of the FRDA. </p>
         <p>Over 14,000 image-based items, primarily prints from the <em>Departement des Estampes et de la
        Photographie</em>, but also illustrations, medals, coins, and other objects, were selected for
        inclusion from across the BnF’s departments. Many originally entered the BnF on legal deposit, but
        others come from important collections acquired in the 19th and early 20th century. Two of these
        collections deserve special attention. The collection of Michel Hennin is notable not only for its
        size, but because it includes many prints omitted from the legal deposit that Hennin amassed during his
        time in Italy working for the Viceroy, Prince Eugène de Beauharnais. The print collection of Carl de
        Vinck, a Belgian diplomat, grew out of his father’s infatuation in Marie-Antoinette and expanded to
        focus more generally on visual representations of France during the century from Marie-Antoinette’s
        marriage to Louis XVI in 1770 until the Paris Commune of 1870. </p>
         <p>The images selected for the digital archive concentrate solely on the period from 1787 through
        1799, from the years immediately preceding the outbreak of the Revolution through the emergence of
        Napoleon. Only visual materials directly tied to the Revolution itself are included. While the texts of
        the AP are primarily of interest to serious students and scholars of the Revolution, these images
        expand the FRDA’s audience to the general public. The creators of the initial incarnation of the
        <em>Images</em> anticipated that scholars would use them for their research and teaching purposes, and
        that the public at large would find in them an important way of learning more about this foundational
        moment for the French nation. </p>
