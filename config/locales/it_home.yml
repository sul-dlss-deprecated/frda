          The online Bassi-Veratti Collection is a multi-year collaboration
          of the Stanford University Libraries, the Biblioteca Comunale
          dell'Archiginnasio, Bologna, Italy, and the Istituto per i Beni
          Artistici, Culturali e Naturali della Regione Emilia-Romagna, to
          produce a digital version of the archive of the influential woman
          scientist, Laura Bassi. Part of the rich collections of the
          Archiginnasio, the collection contains not only materials about
          Laura Bassi, but also those of her husband, scientist Giuseppe
          Veratti, their children, and his family.
