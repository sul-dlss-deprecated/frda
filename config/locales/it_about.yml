        Laura Bassi (1711-1778) was one of the most important and visible
        scientific women in eighteenth-century Europe. In 1732 she was the
        second woman to receive a university degree in Europe and the first
        to be offered an official university teaching position, both at the
        University of Bologna. She was the first female member of the
        Bologna Academy of Sciences, one of Italy’s leading academies, and
        played a significant role in the spread of Newtonian experimental
        physics through her teaching, research, and correspondence. While
        little documentary evidence of her own scientific work survives, she
        nonetheless had an active program of research and experimentation
        for many decades and was widely reputed to be an outstanding teacher
        of experimental physics. Bassi carried on extensive correspondence
        with other natural philosophers of her time, including Alessandro
        Volta, Lazzaro Spallanzani, Giovanni Battista Beccaria,
        Jean-François Nollet, Voltaire, and Francesco Algarotti.
